# How Do I Control My Blood Pressure?

If you have high blood pressure, your heart has to work harder to pump blood around your body. This means that you may be at risk of cardiovascular disease, for example a stroke or a heart attack. You may also be at risk of other problems such as damage to the blood vessels in your kidneys or eyes. 

The higher your blood pressure, the more likely you are to have these problems. But it’s not possible to say what will happen to any individual person and not everyone with high blood pressure will get these problems.

The aim of treating your high blood pressure is to make it less likely you’ll get cardiovascular disease, or stop it getting worse if you already have it (although there is a chance that these things could still happen). High blood pressure is just one of several things that can lead to a stroke or a heart attack.

The actual benefit you might get from lowering your blood pressure depends on several things, such as your chance of having a stroke or a heart attack to start with, your age, sex and your blood pressure at the moment.

Your healthcare professional can help you understand your risk of cardiovascular disease, and may use a risk assessment tool to do this.
