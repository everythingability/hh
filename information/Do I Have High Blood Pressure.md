# Do I Have High Blood Pressure?

Hypertension (high blood pressure) is when the pressure in your blood vessels is too high (140/90 mmHg or higher). It is common but can be serious if not treated.

People with high blood pressure may not feel symptoms. The only way to know is to get your blood pressure checked.

Things that increase the risk of having high blood pressure include:



* older age {ageMsg}
* genetics
* being overweight or obese {overweightMsg} 
* not being physically active 
* high-salt diet
* drinking too much alcohol

## Symptoms

Most people with hypertension don’t feel any symptoms. Very high blood pressures can case headaches, blurred vision, chest pain and other symptoms. 

Checking your blood pressure is the best way to know if you have high blood pressure. If hypertension isn’t treated, it can cause other health conditions like kidney disease, heart disease and stroke.

People with very high blood pressure (usually 180/120 or higher) can experience symptoms including:

* severe headaches
* chest pain
* dizziness
* difficulty breathing
* nausea
* vomiting
* blurred vision or other vision changes
* anxiety
* confusion
* buzzing in the ears
* nosebleeds
* abnormal heart rhythm

If you are experiencing any of these symptoms and a high blood pressure, seek care immediately.

The only way to detect hypertension is to have a health professional measure blood pressure. Having blood pressure measured is quick and painless. Although individuals can measure their own blood pressure using automated devices, an evaluation by a health professional is important for assessment of risk and associated conditions.
