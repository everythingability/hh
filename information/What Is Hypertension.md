# What is Hypertension?


Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a chronic medical condition characterized by elevated pressure in the arteries. Blood pressure is the force exerted by the blood against the walls of the arteries as it flows through them. 

Your blood pressure is measured using two numbers: **systolic** pressure (the pressure when the heart beats) and **diastolic** pressure (the pressure when the heart is at rest between beats). 


Normal blood pressure is typically defined as systolic pressure below **120 mmHg** and diastolic pressure below **80 mmHg**. Hypertension occurs when blood pressure consistently exceeds these normal ranges.
