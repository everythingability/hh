# Medications used to treat hypertension?



### Angiotensin* Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors
  
   *  Examples: Lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), Enalapril (Vasotec), Ramipril (Altace)
   *  How they work: ACE inhibitors block the formation of angiotensin II, a hormone that constricts blood vessels, thereby relaxing blood vessels and lowering blood pressure.



### Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs)
 
   *  Examples: Losartan (Cozaar), Valsartan (Diovan), Irbesartan (Avapro)
   *  How they work: ARBs block the action of angiotensin II at the receptors, causing blood vessels to dilate and blood pressure to decrease.




### Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs)
 
   *  Examples: Amlodipine (Norvasc), Nifedipine (Procardia), Diltiazem (Cardizem)
   *  How they work: CCBs prevent calcium from entering the muscle cells of the heart and blood vessels, leading to relaxation of the arteries and decreased blood pressure



### Beta Blockers

   *  Examples: Metoprolol (Lopressor), Atenolol (Tenormin), Propranolol (Inderal)
   *  How they work: Beta* blockers reduce heart rate and cardiac output by blocking the effects of adrenaline (epinephrine), thereby reducing blood pressure.



### Diuretics
 
   *  Examples: Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), Furosemide (Lasix), Chlorthalidone (Thalitone)
   *  How they work: Diuretics increase urine production, which helps to remove excess sodium and water from the body, reducing blood volume and thus lowering blood pressure.



### Alpha Blockers

   *  Examples: Doxazosin (Cardura), Prazosin (Minipress), Terazosin (Hytrin)
   *  How they work: Alpha* blockers relax certain muscles and help small blood vessels remain open by blocking the action of adrenaline (epinephrine), leading to lower blood pressure.
   
   

### Renin Inhibitors
 
   *  Example: Aliskiren (Tekturna)
   *  How they work: Renin inhibitors block the enzyme renin, which is involved in the regulation of blood pressure by reducing the production of angiotensin I, ultimately leading to decreased levels of angiotensin II and lowered blood pressure.



### Central Agonists

   *  Examples: Clonidine (Catapres), Methyldopa (Aldomet)
   *  How they work: Central agonists work in the brain to decrease sympathetic nervous system activity, which reduces the heart rate and relaxes blood vessels, leading to lower blood pressure.
