Diabetes increases your risk of heart disease and stroke, so it's important that high blood pressure and other problems that increase your risk of heart problems are spotted and treated early.

If you're already being treated to lower your cholesterol or blood pressure, keep taking your medicine.

Diabetes also worsens the effects of smoking on your heart. Get help to quit smoking.
