# Making Lifestyle Changes

If you decide to make lifestyle changes, talk to your healthcare professional about what changes you want to try first.

### What Does This Involve?

Not all of these changes might apply to you, but any will help:

* Eating a healthy diet. This includes reducing the amount of salt you eat, and eating more fruit & veg.
* Being more physically active.
* Trying to get to a healthier weight.
* Avoiding drinking too much alcohol.
* Stopping smoking.

### Advantages

You'll feel healthier and fitter.

* You’re less likely to have a stroke or a heart attack (although this might still happen).
* You might not need to take medicines.


### Disadvantages

* Changing habits can be hard.
* If you stick to lifestyle changes on their own, and your blood pressure is still high, you won’t have lowered your chance of a stroke or a heart attack as much as if you take medicines as well.
