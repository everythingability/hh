# Take Medicines

If you decide to try medicines, you and your healthcare professional can decide together which medicine is best for you.

The first medicine you try might not lower your blood pressure enough on its own, so you might also need to decide whether or not you want to add extra medicines.

### What Does This Involve?

* You’ll take medicines to lower your blood pressure, as well as making lifestyle changes at the same time.
* You'll take one or more medicines every day, long term.

### Advantages

* Medicines can help to lower your blood pressure even more than lifestyle changes on their own.
* You’ll be even less likely to have a stroke or a heart attack (although this might still happen).


### Disadvantages

* You'll have to remember to take your medicines every day.
* There might be times when your blood pressure is too low. This may not always cause symptoms, but some people may feel light headed (especially when they stand up), or even faint.
* You might get side effects from blood pressure medicines (see table 2 on page 5). But not everyone will get side effects and they go away quickly if you stop taking the medicine. They may be short lived or not trouble you if they do happen.
*  You might need blood tests
