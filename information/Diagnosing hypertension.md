# Diagnosing hypertension

When considering a diagnosis of hypertension, measure blood pressure in both arms:

• If the difference in readings between arms is more than 15 mmHg, repeat the measurements.

• If the difference in readings between arms remains more than 15 mmHg on the second measurement, measure subsequent blood pressures in the arm with the higher reading.

If clinic blood pressure is between 140/90 mmHg and 180/120 mmHg, offer ambulatory blood pressure monitoring [ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ](ABPM.md) to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension. 

See the section on identifying who to refer for people with a clinic blood pressure 180/120 mmHg or higher.
