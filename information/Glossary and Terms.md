**Hypertrophy** Enlargement or thickening of the heart muscle, which can be caused by hypertension.

**Insulin Resistance** A condition where cells fail to respond properly to insulin, often associated with obesity and hypertension.

**Ischemia** Reduced blood flow to organs or tissues due to narrowed arteries, often caused by hypertension.

**Jugular Venous Pressure (JVP)** The pressure in the jugular vein, which can be assessed as part of a physical examination to evaluate fluid status and heart function.

**Metabolic Syndrome** A cluster of conditions including high blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels.

**Myocardial Infarction** Commonly known as a heart attack, often associated with untreated hypertension.

**Nitrates** Medications that help relax and widen blood vessels, improving blood flow and reducing blood pressure.

**Nonpharmacological** Referring to treatments or interventions that do not involve medication, such as lifestyle changes or dietary modifications.

**Obesity** Excess body weight, particularly around the waist, which can contribute to hypertension.

**Omega-3 Fatty Acids** Essential fats found in certain fish and nuts, which may have beneficial effects on blood pressure and heart health.

**Orthostatic Hypotension** A sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up from a sitting or lying position.

**Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)** Narrowing of arteries in the legs, stomach, arms, and head, often caused by atherosclerosis and hypertension.

**Potassium** An essential mineral that helps regulate blood pressure and heart function.

**Preeclampsia** A condition characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to other organs during pregnancy, which requires medical attention to prevent complications for both mother and baby.

**Prehypertension** Blood pressure levels that are higher than normal but not yet considered hypertension.

**Pulse** The rhythmic beating of arteries as blood is pumped through them by the heart.

**Quitting Smoking** Cessation of tobacco use, which can significantly reduce the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

**Renin** An enzyme produced by the kidneys that plays a role in regulating blood pressure.

**Resistant Hypertension** High blood pressure that remains elevated despite treatment with multiple antihypertensive medications.

**Salt/Sodium** Excessive intake of salt can lead to high blood pressure, as sodium can cause the body to retain fluid, increasing blood pressure.

**Secondary Hypertension** High blood pressure caused by an underlying condition such as kidney disease or hormonal disorders.

**Sleep Apnea** A sleep disorder characterized by pauses in breathing or shallow breaths during sleep, which can contribute to hypertension.

**Sphygmomanometer** The technical term for the device used to measure blood pressure.

**Stress** Mental or emotional strain, which can temporarily elevate blood pressure.

**Stroke** A serious medical condition that occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, often associated with hypertension.

**Systolic Blood Pressure** The top number in a blood pressure reading, representing the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats.

**Telemedicine** Remote delivery of healthcare services using telecommunications technology, which may include virtual consultations for managing hypertension.

**Thiazide Diuretics** A type of diuretic medication commonly used to treat hypertension.

**Uric Acid** A waste product produced by the body, elevated levels of which may be associated with hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions.

**Vascular** Relating to blood vessels.
